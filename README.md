# g0blin

A work-in-progress iOS 10.3.x jailbreak for 64-bit iDevices (A7 - A9) made from off the shelf parts and shared research.
Long live jailbreaking!


## supported devices

iPod 6G  
iPhone 5S, 6, 6+, 6S, 6S+, SE  
iPad Air, Air 2, 5G (2017), Pro 1G 9.7", Pro 1G 12.9", Mini 2, Mini 3, Mini 4  


## what doesn't work yet?

There are a few things not working yet that are related to a kernel patching issue:
- Touch ID not working in containerized Apps
- Preferences behaving badly in containerized Apps
- debugserver is killed by sandbox when trying to launch an App via Xcode


## what does work?

Everything else?


## instructions

1) Download an offical .ipa file from [g0blin.sticktron.net](http://g0blin.sticktron.net)

2) Install using [Cydia Impactor](http://www.cydiaimpactor.com)


## tips

- if the Cydia icon is hidden you can fix it by adding a new key `SBShowNonDefaultApps` and binary value `YES` to `/User/Library/Preferences/com.apple.springboard.plist` using Filza
- A temporary workaround for TouchID is to turn it off before jailbreaking and then turn it back on afterward


## a note about dropbear

I decided to make installing an SSH server optional for safety reasons, so g0blin RC2 automatically uninstalls dropbear when it runs. Post-RC2 builds no longer do that.

I recommend installing OpenSSH instead. The port will be `22` by default. It can be changed in `/etc/services`.
